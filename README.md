# Buck's Cookbook
A place where I'm putting my recipes. Not quite sure on how the formatting's gonna be. Expect constant evolution.

I've decided I want to learn to cook. This is the place where I'll put things as I cook them. My main reasons for wanting to learn are:

1. **Health**. 80% of West Campus is fried.
2. **Fitness**. I want to know and be in control of what exactly goes into my food and how much. Being fit is worth it 10/10.
3. **Cost**. Apparently, it's a lot cheaper, although there is *definitely* an upfront investment. We'll see how much cheaper it is.
4. **Skill**. It's almost as cool as playing guitar. The fact that Diego's worked in the kitchen at North downtown is really cool.
5. **Ideas**. Whenever I try something new/everything, I get a ton of new ideas that relate back to dev. Maybe I'll brew something up in React Native or React/Electron that becomes a useful tool for cooking. Or maybe I won't be a Javascript junkie at that point.

I'm pretty interested in how much cheaper it is to cook for yourself vs. eat out. I'm tracking costs rounded up to the nearest cent for each ingredient using [HEB-To-You](https://hebtoyou.com/home/) as a reference for prices.

I'm open-sourcing all of these so that people who want to learn to cook have a clear picture of the path and costs. People who want me to cook for them have a kind-of menu. And maybe I'll mine these recipes if I end up developing a tool.

## Equipment
This will be updated as I get new equipment. This is what I mean by the "upfront" invesment.

I'm taking a [buy-it-for-life](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/) approach. By that I mean, I'm buying towards the high-end for equipment so that I don't expect to be buying a better version of the same for at least the next year. If I do end up buying a better version, I'm not removing the old one, since that was part of the "upfront" cost of getting started (and, assuming it still is a part of my equipment set).

Most of this is being financed from my Ethereum wallet.
