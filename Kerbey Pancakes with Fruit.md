## Equipment
- T-fal Nonstick Fry Pan
- Wusthof Pro 8'' Chef's Knife
- OXO Cutting Board

## Directions
1. Mixing: (Yields four or five 5 inch pancakes). 1 cup pancakes; 2 tbsp oil (optional); 1 egg; 2/3 cup water
2. Skillet on low-mid heat
3. Blend Kerbey Pancake Mix, water, oil and egg with a wire whisk until it is free of lumps
4. Pour or ladle about 1/4 cup of batter on skillet for each 5 inch pancake. Drop 1/3 of blueberries or strawberries from their respective cup (or both!?) into pancake (since we're making 6)
5. Cook on griddle for about 2 minutes on the first side.
6. Flip and cook on the second side for about 2 minutes
7. Serve hot with syrup, honey, molasses, jam or jelly and enjoy!

Hints: A griddle that has a non-stick surface or one that has been rubbed lightly with vegetable oil prior to heating will yield the best color and best release. For waffles, add 1 tbsp cooking oil to the batter.
