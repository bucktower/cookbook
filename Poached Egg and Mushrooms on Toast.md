## Equipment
- All-Clad 10 inch fry pan
- All-Clad 3 quart covered sauce pan
- Wusthof Pro 8'' Chef's Knife
- Grill Armor Oven Gloves
- OXO Cutting Board

## Directions
1. Cut up bacon and mushrooms on cutting board
2. Begin to boil water in sauce pan and put bread in toaster (or oven, in my case atm)
2. Throw bacon into fry pan and begin to fry
3. Once bacon reaches a nice pink, throw in mushrooms, mix and cook both
4. Once cooked, empty out fry pan full of mushrooms and bacon onto toast
5. One at a time! Break eggs into a small cup, keeping the yolk intact. Get a circular flow of water going in the sauce pan with a stir and gently pour the egg into the sauce pan. Remove egg with spoon, making sure the white around the yolk holds together, but not too firm.
6. Repeat with other egg, put both on top of mushrooms, bacon, and toast, and slice them down the center to let the yolk run
